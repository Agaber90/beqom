# Difference Between Struct and Class in .NET
The main difference between a **struct** and a **class** is:

- A **struct** is a **value type** and is typically stored in **stack memory**.
  - Structs **do not support inheritance**.
  - They use **value-based equality**, meaning two structs are equal if their values are equal.
  - Structs **cannot be null**.
  - Best suited for **small, lightweight data structures**.

- A **class** is a **reference type** and is stored in **heap memory**.
  - Classes **support inheritance**.
  - They use **reference-based equality**, meaning two references are equal if they point to the same memory location.
  - Classes **can be null**.
  - Better for **complex or large objects**, especially when **shared references** or **inheritance** are needed.
    
# Advantage of Covariance on a Generic Interface
Covariance on a generic interface allows you to use a more specific type where a more general type is expected. For instance, if you have a generic repository interface called `IGenericRepository<out T>`, you can assign a repository of a specific type, such as `IGenericRepository<SpecialOrder>`, to a variable of type `IGenericRepository<Order>`. Assuming `SpecialOrder` inherits from `Order`, this lets you treat this repository of special orders as a repository of general orders, making your code more flexible and type-safe.

# When to Use Contravariance on a Generic Interface
You would use contravariance on a generic interface when you have a handler or processor that works with a general type, but you need to handle a more specific type. 
For instance, an `OrderHandler` that processes general `Order` objects can also be used to handle `SpecialOrder` objects, allowing you to reuse code without writing separate handlers for each specific type.

# Thread-Safe Increment of a Shared Variable

To increment a shared variable safely across multiple threads, you can:
We can use synchronization primitives such as `lock`, `Mutex', or any primitives to ensure that only one thread updates the variable at a time, or use `Interlocked.Increment(ref variable), which provides an atomic increment operation without relying on explicit locks.
